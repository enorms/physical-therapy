# Questions

- Clamshell, is it mainly the top knee? Do I need to do one each side?
- Same for Hip Extension, do once for each leg each rep?

# Usage

Sum numbers:
`python src/main.py sum 2 3 -- -1`

# Test

Run tests:
`python -m pytest tests`

Check types:
`pytype ./src`

# Install

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Architecture choices

## Typing

- MS's Pyright is built into VS Code. So easy to use with IDE, but library not part of repo.

- Google's pytype may do better inference but must be run manually.
-
- mypy / pydantic not scoped for inference

## Style

- use Black as straight out of the box as possible
  - can override with comments in rare cases
- and Prettier for non-Python (i.e. .md)
- Pylint has a setup file from Google to match their style guide
- Use Google Style for general code style

# Setup

- started with simple requirements file
- appears to be good practice to create a module (i.e. for imports)
- and .cfg is more modern, .toml easy to read
- but the pyscaffold is too much for most projects
- so somewhere between basic requirements and a module; moving this repo towards module by default
