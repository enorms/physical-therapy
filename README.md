# Questions

- Clamshell, is it mainly the top knee? Do I need to do one each side?
- Same for Hip Extension, do once for each leg each rep?
- same tension for all? harder for things like 'Standing Hip Abduction with Resistance at Ankles and Counter Support'
- diff Quadriceps Stretch with Chair, Prone Quadriceps Stretch?
- can signout warning be shortened from 13 minutes?
- doing ITB right?
- a little uncertain about 'Gastroc Stretch on Wall' - it's the back calf?
- how long to wait between sets?
